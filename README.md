Histopathologic Cancer Detection Using Data Engineering Tools & AWS
Overview
This project leverages AWS services and machine learning to detect cancer in histopathological images. It integrates data engineering pipelines, cloud computing, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate classification of tissue samples as malignant or benign.

Features
Data Storage: AWS S3 to store and retrieve histopathological image data.
Data Processing: EMR for distributed preprocessing of large datasets.
Model Training: TensorFlow on EC2 for optimizing the CNN architecture.
Web Application: Flask-based interface for image upload and real-time predictions.
Cloud Integration: Seamless use of AWS tools like Boto3 for programmatic interaction.
